# DS-Algo-Implementations

Datastructures and  state-of-the-art algorithms implemented. (University project)

1. AVL Tree (Binary tree that support logn operations).

2. Select Problem solutions (given n items and number k, return the k'th largest item): 
   - Using Random-QuickSort and returning the selected index.
   - Using Insertion-Sort.
   - Using DoubleHeap, Binary Minimum Heap along with auxilary heap.
   - Randomized QuickSelect algorithm.
   - MedOfMed QuickSelect algorithm
